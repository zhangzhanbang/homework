#### a clear sense of life, also a statement of liberty

> things dangerous to come to, 
> to see behind walls, 
> to draw closer, 
> to find each other and to feel. 
> That is the purpose of LIFE. 

## **Three steps to reach one**
- Pick some bricks 
- Try to Stitching
- Believing in endless adjustments

### *1. Discover its diversity*
- Basic language = basic tools
   what we  will learn are probably C/C++ & Python & Java && html
 ![Language](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zhangzhanbang/homework/gh-pages/images/language.jpg)
 </br>

- Basic algorithm = advanced tools
1. Your Own ideas and flexible mind
2. Date structure
3. Graph theory
4. String related
5. Number Theory

>Both language and algorithm need continous effort.

### *2. Try more*
- Game design

example : Unity3D  （Fairies Story in **New Game !**）

> Trying different things helps you experience different kinds of worlds.
> You will learn more methods to build your own world and more ways to show your ideas --- to make your world a better place

### *3. Create a new world*
> Now you've learnt all you need, and it's time to create your dream world.
> You may think of rebuilding the net --- decentralized network, just like Richard Hendricks in Silicon Valley Season 5.
> Or you have a willing to create a real world in a virtual one, just like the green land in Ready Player One.
> Though you have no ideas about the future, I'm convinced that you would meet her one day.

## ***In the end, let us cheer for the bright future!***
